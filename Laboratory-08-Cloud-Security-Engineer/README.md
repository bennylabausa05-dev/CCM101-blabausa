## Mission Overview
Congratulations! Your proactive approach to system monitoring has earned you a spot on the elite 
Cloud Security Team at CloudNova Technologies. 
In the cloud, leaving a server unsecured for even a few minutes can lead to automated brute-force 
attacks and data breaches. Your mission today applies the security concepts you learned in Chapter 8. You will 
implement the principle of defense in depth by locking down a live server using a host-based firewall. 
Using the KillerCoda Playground, you will step into the role of a Cloud Security Engineer. You will 
deploy a web application, audit the server's open ports, and configure the Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW) to block 
malicious traffic while allowing legitimate users to access the application. 
Remember: Security is not a product you buy; it is a continuous process you maintain.

## Objectives
At the end of this laboratory activity, you should be able to: 
- Understand the concept of the Attack Surface and the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP).
- Perform a basic security audit of active network ports on a Linux server.
- Configure the Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW) with a Default Deny policy.
- Implement granular port management to selectively allow SSH and HTTP traffic.
- Document firewall rules and security best practices using Markdown.
- Continue expanding your professional GitHub Cloud Computing Portfolio.

## Commands Executed
* docker run -d --name secure-web-app -p 8080:80 nginx
* curl http://localhost:8080
* sudo ufw allow ssh
* sudo ufw default deny incoming  
* sudo ufw default allow outgoing
* sudo ufw enable
* sudo ufw status verbose
* sudo ufw allow 8080/tcp
* sudo ufw status numbered

### Skills Learned
- Set-up firewall
- enable firewall
- deny or allow incoming traffic
